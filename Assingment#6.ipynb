    "1) Data Abstraction: - Data Abstraction is that in which A User Can use any of the data and Method from the Class Without knowing about how this is created So in other words we can say that A user can use all the Functions without Knowing about its detail For Example When a User gives Race to Car The Car will be Moved but a User doesn’t know how its Engine Will Work.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Inheritance:- Inheritance is very popular Concept in OOP’s This provides the Capability to a user to use the Predefined Code or the code that is not created by the user himself but if he may wants to use that code then he can use that code This is Called Inheritance but Always Remember in Inheritance a user only using the code but he will not be able to change the code that is previously created he can only use that code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Data Encapsulation :- Data Encapsulation is also Known as Data Hiding as we know with the inheritance concept of OOP’s a  user can use any code that is previously created but  if a user wants to use that code then it is must thatpreviously code must be Public as the name suggests public means for other peoples but if a code is Private then it will be known as Encapsulate and user will not be able to use that code So With the help of OOP’s we can alter or change the code means we can make the Code as Private or public  This allows us to make our code either  as public or private\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Polymorphism  :- Poly Means  many and morphism means many function The Concepts Introduces in the form of  Many behaviors of an object Like an Operator + is used for Addition of Two Numbers and + is also used for Joining two names The Polymorphism in C++ Introduces in the Form of Functions Overloading and  in the Form of Constructor Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Dynamic Binding:- Binding is used when we call the Code of the Procedure in Binding all the Code that is Linked with the single procedure is Called When a Call is Made to that Procedure Then the Compiler will found the Entire code of the Single Procedure if A Compiler will Fond all the Code of Single Procedure in Compile Time then it is Called as the Early Binding Because Compiler Knows about the code at the time of Compilation but in the Late Binding Compiler will understand all the Code at  Run Time or at the Time of the Execution."

    "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value).
